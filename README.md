My GitHub account makes it possible for me to make use of the GitHub repositories to store my data. I am also able to collaborate on software because I have an account. 

The repository that I created is a place in GitHub where I can store and manage data and files. It provides me with the update history so I can easily go back and forth between versions. 

To clone my repository, I first had to create an account on GitHub. After doing so, I was able to create a repository on the GitHub website. Next, I downloaded the GitHub Desktop application and clone my original repository onto my computer.
